Goal of the game: 

Level up the purple bar to the max in order to win !
Each time you go on a civilian on boat, his boat will flow and you earn a kill !
Each kill rewards you with 10% of the green bar.
While the green bar is loaded at 100%, it reset to 0%, you are rewarded with 10% of the purple bar.
Be carrefull ! The timer doesn't stop ! Each 30 seconds more cops or duck will try to catch you !
If you have been hit three time it's the game over ! 
Cops can't go on water but ducks can.
